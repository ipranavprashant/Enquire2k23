              We are the brainchild of a dedicated group of quizzers at NIT
              Calicut. Established in 2002, we are synonymous with our signature
              events during Tathva and Ragam, and Enquire Quiz Leagues. We
              conduct about 20 quizzes every year. Enquire Quiz Club, being the
              quiz club of NITC, holds quizzes across the state and works to
              expand its frontier every year. Besides the presence of alumni in
              IIMs and other national level institutes, Enquire has conducted
              quizzes at KQA events. Enquire has also consistently maintained
              its position as the biggest quiz club in the state.
